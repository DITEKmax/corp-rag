# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-05-11)

**Core value:** Employees can ask natural-language questions over permitted corporate documents and receive grounded, cited answers without leaking data across access boundaries.
**Current focus:** Phase 01 — foundation-contracts

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent locked decisions affecting current work:

- ADR-001: Use bge-m3 for dense+sparse embeddings.
- ADR-002: Use Qdrant for vector storage and payload-filtered retrieval.
- ADR-003: Split Java Spring backend and Python AI service.
- [Phase 01]: Root contracts/ remains the only shared source location for REST, event, and generated constant contracts. — Plan 01-01 verified api-v1.yaml, ai-service-v1.yaml, events-v1.yaml, and constants.yaml as the shared contract baseline.
- [Phase 01]: Plan 01-05 keeps the Phase 1 frontend static and nginx-served with no JavaScript modules, routing, API client, or auth/session guard. — Matches D-22 and D-26; real UI behavior is deferred to Phase 6.
